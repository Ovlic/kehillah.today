    Ho ho ho!<br>
    Your wit and your skill, your talentful lurk,<br>
    It was all needed to kill Dorbus, the jerk.<br>
    For, thanks to your help, you saved Christmas Day,<br>
    And maybe even had a little fun on the way.<br>
    For while I hope your hunt was a delight,<br>
    Merry Christmas to Zorb! And to all a good night!<br>
